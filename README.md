Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to use the kickstarter dataset to analyze and visualize the outcomes based on goals and outcomes based on launch date. The visualization was done with pivot tables and graphs. 


Analysis and Challenges

The analysis for deliverable 1 was done adding a year column, and then creating a pivot table to show theater outcomes by launch date (in a month format). Deliverable 2 used CONTIFD() to get the outcome and goal data for the “plays” subcategory. 


Deliverable 1 was relatively straightforward compared to deliverable 2. The outcomes based on goals chart took much more attention, and grappling with the new function, COUNTIFS(). In addition to double, triple checking the grouping in the “goal” column. Another challenge, one I wasn’t quite able to solve, was formatting the “outcomes based on goal” line chart. 


Results

The most successful months for the theater launch dates were the summer months, May, June and July being the most successful. While the least successful months, November, December, January, were in winter. We can conclude the seasons impact the success of theater plays. 
Looking at the Outcomes based on Goals, more projects were successful if the goal was under $9999. 
Some of the limitations of the dataset include; having too broad of location (can’t filter by state), and not knowing the specifics of how a project got all their money (did one person donate most of what was needed?).
